# PromptEngineering_GPT4_Q-LAB_2025

This repository gathers my work from the **Prompt Engineering with GPT-4** summer course at **Q-LAB 2025**.  
It includes two main assignments and a final project, all developed in Google Colab.

Summary:
- Processed the academic paper *Attention Is All You Need* (Vaswani et al., 2017).
- Split text into ~512-token chunks using `tiktoken`.
- Generated embeddings with `text-embedding-3-small`.
- Stored and queried the data using **ChromaDB**.
- Implemented a `retrieve_documents(query)` function to fetch the most relevant chunks.
- Built an interactive chatbot using `gpt-4o-mini`, capable of:
  - Producing structured outputs (summary, topics, sentiment).
  - Maintaining conversation history.
  - Solving math problems using **Chain-of-Thought** reasoning.

Summary:
- Developed advanced RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) chatbots:
  - Applied techniques like query transformation, proposition chunking, or HyDe embedding.
  - Compared basic vs. advanced RAG performance.
  - Integrated **function calling** to determine when retrieval was needed.
- Built a multi-agent system with **CrewAI** for event planning:
  - Included agents for venue coordination, logistics, marketing, and overall management.
  - Used web scraping and search-based retrieval where necessary.
  - Produced a final consolidated report summarizing all planning efforts.
